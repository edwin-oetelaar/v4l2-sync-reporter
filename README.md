# Some framegrabbers (v4l2) have multiple inputs
# This project allows auto select based on which input actually has signal 
# Will report status on all inputs, for easy trouble shooting
# Simple interface to script from command line linux
# run this program before letting VLC or FFMPEG encode your camera
# no need to specify the video input anymore, it is already selected
# This program is GPL2, or you can request an alternative commercial license.
# Happy frame grabbing!
# Have a very happy day.
